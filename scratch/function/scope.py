'''
    When mutable data is passed to a function,
    the function can modify or alter it.
    These modifications will stay in effect
    outside the function scope as well.
    An example of mutable data is a list.

    In the case of immutable data,
    the function can modify it,
    but the data will remain unchanged outside
    the functionâ€™s scope.
    Examples of immutable data are numbers, strings, etc.

    print("Value of num inside:", num)
    return n
